/*
you have SetWidth and SetHeight methods on your Rectangle base class; 
this seems perfectly logical. However if your Rectangle reference pointed to a Square, 
then SetWidth and SetHeight doesn't make sense because setting one would change the other to match it. 
In this case Square fails the Liskov Substitution Test 
with Rectangle and the abstraction of having Square inherit from Rectangle is a bad one. */
